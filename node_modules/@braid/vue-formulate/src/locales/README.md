# i18n moved

Locales have been removed from vue-formulate core to [vue-formulate-i18n](https://github.com/wearebraid/vue-formulate-i18n).
This was done to allow for better tree-shaking by bundlers and allow
for lots of additional language support without increasing the size of the core package.

## PRs welcome

[Please read the i18n contribution documentation](https://www.vueformulate.com/guide/contributing/#internationalization).
